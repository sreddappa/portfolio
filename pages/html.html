        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <article>
          <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</p>  
          <p>HTML Elements form the building blocks of all websites</p>

        <h3>The stuff that makes HTML</h3>
        <article>
          <p>The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content and apply meaning to it.</p>  
          <p>Tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information. Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks. They look something like</p>
          <xmp><tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag></xmp>
          <p>Tags tend not to do much more than mark the beginning and end of an element. Elements are the bits that make up web pages.  For example,  everything that is in between (and includes) tags is the body element.
